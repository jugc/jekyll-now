Hi! I am an experienced researcher with a demonstrated history of R&D in clean energy. My highly interdisciplinary skills include numerical and mathematical modeling, data analysis, software development, proficiency in scripting languages (python, Matlab), and technical writing. My educational background is a mix of disciplines within engineering (electrical, computer and mechanical):

* A **Ph.D.** in Engineering (focus on Wind Energy) from The Technical University of Denmark in Roskilde. My dissertation's title was *[Electromechanical Drivetrain Simulation](http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/electromechanical-drivetrain-simulation%284cc15b63-4c63-4586-9edd-4395fb121438%29.html)*. The objective was to develop a simulation tool that would help us identify the drivers of premature failure of the bearings inside a wind turbine drivetrain. The main deliverable was a code that simulates the dynamics of the drivetrain components together with the wind turbine structure. A list of my publications can be found [here](/work/).
* A **Master of Science Degree** in Electrical Engineering from California State University, Fresno. My graduation project aimed at studying the energy efficiency of operating an electric motor with different types of electric drives. This resulted in the publication titled: *[Gallego-Calderon, J. and Bengiamin, N. (2013) “Efficient Drives for Single-phase AC Motors: Analysis and Applications.” International Journal of Modern Engineering, 13(2):25–33](http://www.ijme.us/issues/spring2013/abstracts/Z__IJME%20spring%202013%20v13%20n2%20(paper%203).pdf).*

* A **Bachelor's Degree** in Electronics Engineering from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Cali, Colombia (my hometown).

On a more personal level, I am a fan of local beer (especially IPAs), dogs, travel, coffee and the outdoors. I am a passionate climber, backcountry skier and runner -- if it happens in the mountains, I am game! You can see more of my adventures [here](https://www.instagram.com/thewannabealpinist/).

### What am I up to now?

I am in the process of a life re-start in the U.S. After living in Europe (Denmark and Switzerland) for over four years, I am ready to move closer to home. Currently, I am brushing up my statistics and getting up to speed in the tools used in industry, so I can incorporate the methods used in **Data Science** in my career. I am deeply passionate about renewable energies and my focus at the moment is to integrate statistical methods and machine learning into my work as a researcher. As of now, I am looking for opportunities in the wind energy industry, but in the mean time I continue learning new subjects.

1. For statistics, I am following the [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) course by Standford. Personally, I enjoy the academic approach taken by the course and that it uses R. I am not too familiar with R yet, because I have been using python until now. This will force me to learn another useful language for a Data Science career.
2. For programming, I am continuously learning about python and recently began learning R. In addition, I am forcing myself to become familiar with SQL queries since I never used it during my Ph.D. and postdocs. I was accessing the data in the cluster via terminal, but I never had an SQL database.

I am sure that these are not enough to become a data scientist, but I believe in starting small with simple tasks in order to maximize results.
