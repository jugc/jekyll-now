Hi! I am an experienced researcher with a demonstrated history of R&D in clean energy research. Highly interdisciplinary skills that include numerical and mathematical modeling, data analysis, software development, proficiency in scripting languages (python, Matlab), and technical writing.

### What am I up to now?

I am in the process of a life re-start in California. After working in academia for over four years, I am ready to try the industry. Currently, I am brushing up my statistics and getting up to speed in the tools used in industry, so I can transition to a career in Data Science.
