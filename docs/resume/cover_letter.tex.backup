Enclosed is my application to be considered for the position of Assistant Professor in Energy Resources Engineering (Job \# 7670) as announced in the CSU Humboldt careers website. I feel extremely qualified for this position because of my formal doctoral training in engineering and my research experience in wind energy, energy efficiency and systems design. I have an interdisciplinary education that includes electrical, mechanical and computer engineering that I am sure will be of great use to continue and improve the education efforts in your Department and the research carried out at the Schatz Energy Research Center.

Throughout my Ph.D I have had the opportunity to present lectures and seminars to fellow graduate students, researchers and professors. This provided me the opportunity to convey my ideas and research results in a clear and concise manner. However, my first hand teaching experience at the university level began while carrying out my Master studies at Fresno State. I had the good fortune of being a Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering laboratory (ECE1L) and the Microcontrollers laboratory (ECE120L). This experience sparked an interest in college level teaching given the involvement with students in class projects. The dynamic nature of a teaching position in an university is my main reason for applying to this position. This has allowed me to experience a different kind of public speaking, where communicating my ideas clearly was paramount, and to interact with the students so they could be successful in their class. The interaction involved a combination of different teaching methodologies such as lecturing, by explaining the basic concepts of programing, syntax of the language and algorithm building; demonstration, by showing examples that are already implemented and the expected results; and collaboration, since it was a laboratory setting where the students had to work in groups. Moreover, I truly enjoyed the interaction with students of different social backgrounds and participating in an environment where critical thinking was important, not only to finish their projects, but also to actually learn the underlying concepts presented in the class.

From my experience during the Ph.D. degree and postdoctoral position, I feel I have acquired the skills that make me eligible for this position. These positions involved a great deal of independent research, self-motivation and tenacity.  In addition, the knowledge I gained in model development, implementation and simulation of systems are relevant for the position requirements, specially in the area of renewable energies and power systems. The outcome of my dissertation was based on an electromechanical drivetrain simulation tool I developed. The tool was programmed in Matlab and it is coupled to an external software in order to simulate the entire wind turbine. This co-simulation approach opens the door for the implementation of interdisciplinary models including electrical, mechanical and aeroelastic systems. In addition to model development and implementation, machine controls were necessary in order to maintain stability in the entire system. This allowed me to explore different disciplines such as electric machines, system dynamics, control and mechanics. Although my PhD studies were more focused on the mechanical engineering field, my background is in electrical engineering and I am capable of teaching courses on both subjects, as well as conducting research. In addition to my research experience during my studies at DTU, I was able to visit the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for three months to carry out my external stay of research. During this time, I was interacting with some of the top researches and engineers in the field of wind energy. This experience was an epiphany during my Ph.D. studies since I was able to not only validate my models with state-of-the-art research facilities, but also to build a software capable of simulating the gearbox dynamics, while coupled with a dynamic model of a generator. Moreover, due to the success of my visit, I continue to communicate with the group at NREL in order to continue our collaboration. For example, my interest in developing electromechanical models that are accurate enough, but yet, computationally efficient, is shared by my colleagues at NREL. One of the common interest is to develop an electrical-mechanical-structural model of an electric machine in order to study the air-gap dynamics along with its effect in the high-speed shaft bearings due to: mechanical loads form the wind turbine structure, and electric loading from the grid such as grid faults and power balance.

I am very thankful for the opportunity of having an international background. I did my B.Sc. in Colombia, my M.Sc. in the United States and my Ph.D. in Denmark. Not only have I had the pleasure to meet and relate to different cultures, but also to interact with people from different socio-economical backgrounds. Thus, being a student in different countries allowed me to experience different teaching methodologies that, in addition to giving me a global perspective on teaching methods, will allow to experiment with proven methods in the classroom. For example, as a graduate student I appreciated having courses utilizing a ``flipped classroom'' approach rather than the traditional lecture style; I felt more involved and challenged. I envision developing course material utilizing traditional lectures, flipped classroom, and other active learning methodologies, which will  allow for students with different learning abilities to benefit from the topics I want to convey.  

From the course list in the Department's website, I have identified the following courses, which I could immediately teach:
\begin{itemize}
 \item ENGR 211. Solid Mechanics: Dynamics.
 \item ENGR 322. Environmental Data Modeling and Analysis.
 \item ENGR 371. Energy Systems and Technology.
 \item ENGR 475. Renewable Energy Power Systems.
\end{itemize}

I am not limited to these courses only; I am also open to participate in other courses that the Department finds me suitable for, obviously with the support of more experienced faculty from the Department. In addition, I am qualified to develop and teach upper division courses, which I believe are relevant to the field of renewable energy, specially in wind energy. These courses may include for example: Mechanical Vibrations, Dynamics of Rotating Machinery, Systems Modeling and Simulation, Multibody Dynamics and numerical methods, Electric Machines--concepts and modeling, and Wind Energy Engineering. 

During my career I have had the opportunity to interact closely with many undergraduate and graduate students. I am dedicated to a research-based education, where the active participation of the students in a meaningful research experience is paramount for their success. As an example of a possible project for students interested in wind energy and working under my supervision could be ``the development of a small scale test-rig for testing using Hardware-in-the-loop techniques''; such a project could involve both graduate and undergraduate students. This will require a set of interdisciplinary skills in instrumentation, programming and hardware, that I am sure the students in the Department will find valuable.

In summary, I feel I have the interdisciplinary skills that are necessary to successfully perform in this position. Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
