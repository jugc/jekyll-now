title: Life restart
---

I am writing this post while waiting for a flight to leave Switzerland. A couple of days ago, I received my U.S. visa and I booked my flight. Now my wife, my dog, and I are going to live in beautiful California. We see this new adventure as a life restart because we don't have anything settled there. Up until now, we have moved from country to country because of a job, so there was a clear goal and a game plan. Now it is not the case anymore.

For the past five years, we have lived in Europe. Four years in Copenhagen, Denmark, and one year in Lausanne, Switzerland. While in Denmark, I was working on my doctorate and subsequently on a postdoc.
